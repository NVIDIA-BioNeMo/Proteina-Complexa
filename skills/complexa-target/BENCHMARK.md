## What This Report Answers

The three-tier evaluation checks whether the skill:

- is safe to use;
- produces correct answers;
- is discovered and activated when needed;
- helps the agent complete the user's goal and expected workflow; and
- avoids wasted skill and tool usage.

## Results at a Glance

| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 94.5% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 88.7% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 25.0% → 75.0% (+50.0 points) |
| Correctness | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 93.3% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 81.7% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Effectiveness | 97.5% → 100.0% (+2.5 points) | 97.5% → 98.8% (+1.3 points) |
| Efficiency | 78.9% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 87.9% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |

**How to read this table:** baseline is the same task attempted without the target skill. Scores are rounded to one decimal; threshold-adjacent values use additional precision so their displayed band matches the verdict. Uplift is derived from those displayed scores and shown in percentage points.

Example: `47.0% → 92.0% (+45.0 points)` means the skill-assisted run scored 92.0%, 45.0 percentage points above its 47.0% no-skill baseline.

A partial dimension was calculated from only the available configured signals; review the detailed report before relying on it.

Prompt tokens include cached reads, so total tokens are `prompt + completion` (cached is not added twice). The Efficiency score uses `(prompt - cached) + completion`. N/A means the relevant trajectory counters were not available; coverage is never estimated.

## Scoring Methodology

<details>
<summary>Show dimension definitions, source signals, and thresholds</summary>

| Dimension | Question | Scored signals |
|---|---|---|
| Security | Is it safe to use? | `security` (100%) |
| Correctness | Is the answer correct? | `accuracy` (100%) |
| Discoverability | Was the right skill loaded when needed? | `skill_execution` (100%) |
| Effectiveness | Did the skill help complete the task? | `goal_accuracy` (50%) + `behavior_check` (50%) |
| Efficiency | Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? | `skill_efficiency` (50%) + `token_efficiency` (50%) |

- Dimension bands: PASS at 50% or above; NEUTRAL from 40% to below 50%; FAIL below 40%.
- Overall Tier 3 lift: PASS at +5 points or more; FAIL at -10 points or less; values between those bands are NEUTRAL.
- Overall verdict: PASS only when every configured dimension passes for at least one supported agent. Lift is reported as diagnostic evidence and does not override this gate.
- The 50% attempt pass threshold is a separate per-task gate; it is not the dimension pass threshold.
- Effectiveness is the equal-weight mean of goal completion (`goal_accuracy`) and expected workflow adherence (`behavior_check`).
- Efficiency is 50% tool-call productivity (the backward-compatible `skill_efficiency` wire id) and 50% `token_efficiency`. Positive-case skill routing is scored under Discoverability, not Efficiency; a negative case without a routing target is N/A. N/A sources are omitted, remaining weights are renormalized, and the dimension is marked partial.

Signals present in this run:

- `security` (Security): unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access.
- `skill_execution` (Skill Execution): whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed.
- `skill_efficiency` (Tool Productivity): tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability).
- `accuracy` (Accuracy): final-answer correctness against the reference answer.
- `goal_accuracy` (Goal Accuracy): whether the user's goal was achieved.
- `behavior_check` (Behavior Check): whether the expected workflow behavior was followed.
- `token_efficiency` (Token Efficiency): actual uncached prompt plus completion usage (50% of Efficiency).
