## Description: <br>
Agent runbook for Proteina-Complexa parameter sweeps through the separately installed first-party CLI and config generator. <br>

This skill is for research and development only. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Multiple licenses (see LICENSE) <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and researchers use this skill to run cartesian-product parameter sweeps over Proteina-Complexa protein design pipelines, author sweeper YAML configurations, compare ablations, and rank results by success rate and computational cost via Pareto analysis. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative) with 3 attempts per task, each in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal (50% goal completion + 50% expected workflow adherence). <br>
- Efficiency: Avoidance of wasted tool calls and token usage (50% tool-call productivity + 50% token efficiency). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
